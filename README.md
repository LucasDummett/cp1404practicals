# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## Contents
This repository contains the weekly practical assessments for the Programming II subject.
I have enjoyed learning the fundamentals of python code and wish I had done this sooner in my engineering course.

## 3 important lessons I have learned:
- Naming conventions seriously improve the readability of code.
- Properly reading assessment requirements thoroughly has ensured I don't go outside the box and lose marks.
- It's important to watch the lectures properly before seminars and practicals to do better.
